$ npm i
$ PATH=$PATH:./node_modules/.bin/
$ parcel index.html

ideas for improvement:
banking based on curves (derivations of normals/tangents)
edges on path (lines, tubes)
translucency and shading, esp in the middle of the ribbon
animation down path
altitude bridges, mapping to ground
time/distance tracks
speckling along path
better path colors, materials, translucency, shading, gradients, lighting, reflection, speckling, ...
other examples like AceTracks?
more waypoints, fancier paths, more accurate registration when introduced on maps
cleanup endpoints of ribbon (like line caps)
general translucency of ribbon to see underneath like maps
aircraft obj overlay - loading, orientation, translation, animations
